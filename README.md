# ME491: Data Science for Engineers
This repository provides course materials for the technical electives course ME491 on Data Science at UH MƒÅnoa.

The course materials provided in this repository are based on the textbook [Data-Driven Science and Engineering](https://databookuw.com) by Steven L. Brunton and J. Nathan Kutz. Chapters covered in the course are:
* Chapter 1: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  * 1.1 Overview
  * 1.2 Matrix Approximation
  * 1.3 Mathematical Properties and Manipulations
  * 1.4 Pseudo-Inverse, Least-Squares, and Regression
  * 1.5 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  * 1.6 Eigenfaces Example
* Chapter 4: Regression and Model Selection
  * 4.1 ClassicCurveFitting
  * 4.2 Nonlinear Regression and Gradient Descent
  * 4.3 Regression and Ax = b: Over- and Under-Determined Systems
  * 4.4 Optimization as the Cornerstone of Regression
  * 4.5 The Pareto Front and *Lex Parsimoniae*
  * 4.6 Model Selection: Cross-Validation
  * 4.7 Model Selection: Information Criteria
* Chapter 5: Clustering and Classification
  * 5.1 Feature Selection and Data Mining
  * 5.2 Supervised versus Unsupervised Learning
  * 5.3 Unsupervised Learning: k-Means Clustering
  * 5.6 Supervised Learning and Linear Discriminants
  * 5.7 Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Chapter 6: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  * 6.1 Neural Networks: Single-Layer Networks
  * 6.2 Multi-Layer Networks and Activation Functions
  * 6.3 The Backpropagation Algorithm
  * 6.4 The Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm
  * 6.6 Neural Networks for Dynamical Systems

In this repository, you can find a collection of [lecture notes](https://github.com/xiyudu/ME491/tree/main/Lecture_Notes), [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/xiyudu/ME491/tree/main/Jupyter_Notebooks), [data used](https://github.com/xiyudu/ME491/tree/main/Data) and [a sample course schedule](https://github.com/xiyudu/ME491/blob/main/course_schedule.md). If you are offering a similar course and want my sample homeworks, exams and filled in-class Jupyter Notebooks, please [email me](mailto:xiyudu@hawaii.edu).

The authors of the textbook host a very nice website, where you can find [YouTube videos](https://databookuw.com/page-2/page-4/), and code for the textbook in both [MatLab](https://github.com/dynamicslab/databook_matlab) and [Python](https://github.com/dynamicslab/databook_python).

Special thanks for [Dr. Zhuoyuan Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1E8jexYAAAAJ&hl=en) for providing me his course materials when I was developing my course.
